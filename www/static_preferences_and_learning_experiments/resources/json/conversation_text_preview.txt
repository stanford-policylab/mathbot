  Let me know when you're ready to see an example

   To find b<sub>11</sub>, we should plug in n = 11 to
   b<sub>n</sub> = 4 + 3(n - 1).

    [4-3-10-c1fqmu]
    b<sub>n</sub> = 4 + 3(n - 1) b<sub>11</sub> = 4 + 3(11

   The 1st term of the sequence is 2, so <b>A = 2</b>. The

   our values of A and B to <b>a(n) = A + B(n - 1)</b>.
